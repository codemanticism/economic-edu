If you want to be economically concious of political decisions made by you. Here are some tips:
  <ol>
<li> Don't vote for a populist (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/26/do-populists-always-crash-the-economy#:~:text=So%20far%20the%20impact%20of,Moritz%20Schularick%20and%20Christoph%20Trebesch.">The Guardian</a>), whether conservative or progressive, as they, generally speaking, are bad choices, research show. What characterizes populism is that it seeks to attack some kind of supposed elite that exists within a society, like a political elite or an economic elite, besides opposition to well-established research and institutions.</li>
<li> Watch sources with different positions on the economic left-right spectrum, so that you can develop an opinion on how the economy is performing in multiple categories: That way you can get a better of idea of if the poverty reduction has really been worth the GDP per capita growth stagnating because of the lack of economic liberalization. After all, if the standard of living over 99% of the population is already not miserable, even as, say, 30% might be relatively poor for that country's poverty line, does it make sense from an economic perspective? I myself developed the [Poverty Index](https://codemanticism.github.io/economic-edu/explorer.html), and you can view it here in the website, and it quantifies the amount of poverty from various groups of income by multipliying values which represent the level of poverty by the how much of the population is in that level.</li>
<li> Vote for candidates that tend to be less fallacious and follow more the economic orthodoxy: Combining economic liberalization with directed investment towards certain parts of the economy, and, in the case of high-income economies, more generous welfare generally is a good economic policy.</li>
<li> For people who live in low-income, middle-income economies and even some non-developed high-income economies: Does it really make more sense to vote for a social-democratic candidate, when the economy isn't rich enough to support social democracy? Would voting for a neoliberal in that case make more sense even if it is less generous to poor people, as it would increase more the general societal welfare of the population.</li>
