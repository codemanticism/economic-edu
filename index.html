<h1></h1>How to be economically aware of political choices you make?</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Avoid voting for populists: Whether conservative or progressive, economic populism generally disobeys well-established economic orthodoxy in the name of something more palatable to the average person. Populism is generally characterized by oversimplified ideas, whether presenting an intelectual elite's values as clashing with the interest of the common right-wing hardworking man or distrustring well-established economic research or institutions or portraying the other side of the economic debate as having inherently less empathy necessarily simply because of less generous views on welfare or populism simplifying complex realities. Generally the center tends to be more moderate and less populist. However there are center-left populists. </li>
  <li>Listen to economic experts: Not just any think tank that wants a grab of the attention of the common man, but qualified well-trained experts with views that align with economic consesus.</li>
  <li>Listen to media outlets that are in different places in the economic spectrum: That way political bias with regards to the matter of how to deal with the economy can be reduced.</li>
</ol>
